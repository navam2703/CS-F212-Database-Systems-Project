# CS-F212-Database-Systems-Project
A web application consisting of a Hospital management system and was implemented for our project for the course CS F212-Databse systems.

It is a group project of 4 in which we made a Hospital management system through a web application. It supported functionalities like registering a new patient and doctor, booking/cancelling an appointment of a specified doctor and collecting feedbacks from patients and doctors. All of these tasks were monitored by an admin who looked after the hospital management. We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap in the frontend and PHP, MySQL in the backend. Apache was used as a local server.
